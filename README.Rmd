# STAT545

## Assignment 3 Repository

This assignment uses dplyr and ggplot2 to answer some well-defined statistical questions (and one not-so-well defined question).


**To marking TA**: Sorry! I only saw your comment recently on my HW02 about how to include a table of contents, so I didn't include it in this assignment. I will make sure to add it in my next assignment!
